## Progress

| State | Client | Server |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Handshake | 100% | 100% |
| Status | 100% | 100% |
| Login | 100% | 100% |
| Configuration | 100% | 100% |
| Play* | 100% | 114/124 |

\* not all packets have been tested, or their functionality is not fully implemented

> online mode (packet encryption) will probably never be supported
